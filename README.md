# glucometer

As a person with type 1 diabetes, I know how important it is to keep track of your blood glucose levels.
My particular device (an Accu-Check Active) has a USB port but no drivers and no software is provided to actually retrieve its internal data for further use.

Glucometer aims to provide just that: a free and open-source option for those who want to retrieve and analyze the data from blood glucose meters with USB connectivity. It's built according to the IEEE11073 standard for personal health devices.
